#%% Waves
# 1.	Create a time variable that starts at 0 and ends at 2*pi
    # a.	use whatever granularity you want


#%%# 2.	Create a sine wave variable



#%%# 3.	Create an animation of the sine wave over time 
    # a.	You should see the wave get created
    
    
    # b.	Save .gif


#%%# 4.	Create a cosine wave variable



#%% 5.	Create an animation of the cosine wave over time 
    # a.	Save .gif


#%% 6.	Create a figure with 2 subplots
    # a.	Sine wave and Cosine wave over time
    
    
    # b.	Sine (x) and cosine (y) waves together

 

#%% Extra Credit

# Create a 3D Spiral


#%% 1.	Create a time variable from 1 to 1000




#%% 2.	Create an x variable that is a sine wave across time





#%% 3.	Create an y variable that is a sine wave across time





#%% 4.	Animate  X (on x axis),Y (on y axis), and Time (on z axis) on the same figure to produce a 3D spiral (see examples below)
