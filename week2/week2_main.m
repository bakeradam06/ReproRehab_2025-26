%% Creating some data
% Create a folder with name "Data"


% Within the "Data" folder, add two folders: "Subject 1" & "Subject 2"


% Within each "Subject X", add two files: data.csv and info.txt


% Add three numbers, separated by commas in each data.csv (e.g., 1,2,3)


% Add name to info.txt (e.g., Dan)


% Make sure numbers and names are unique to subject







%% Script
% Write a loop that iterates through all folders in the "Data" folder


% Write a nested loop that iterates through all "Subject X" folders


% Write code to load the data from data.csv and info.txt and print the results


% Store the data as a dict (Python) / struct (MATLAB), where data from info is key and data from data is value (e.g., Dan: [1,2,3])


% Add another subject folder and verify that everything works and new data is added. 
    % The goal here is to not have to modify the script every time a new subject is added


% MATLAB only: pre-allocate an array to hold your data
