%% Data
    % 1.	Generate two sets of data (2D matrices) that will represent the control and test groups walking speed 
        % a.	The control group has 21 participants and completed 100 trials each
            % i.	Generate with normal random, mean of 7, standard deviation of 1.2
        % b.	The test group has 17 participants and completed 100 trials each 
            % i.	Generate with normal random, mean of 3, standard deviation of 5

            

%% Summarize Data


% 1.	Calculate the average walking speed per participant (across trials) for each group
% 2.	Calculate the standard deviation of walking speed per participant (across trials) for each group
% 3.	Calculate the average walking speed per trial (across participants) for each group
% 4.	Calculate the standard deviation of walking speed per trial (across participants) for each group




%% Normality
% 1.	Check to see if the average walking speed per group passes a normality test (Kruski-Wallis?)





%% Comparison
% 1.	Run a t-test (or non-parametric equivalent if wanted / needed) comparing the average walking speed between groups
